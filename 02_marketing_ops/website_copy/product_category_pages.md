## Strategy Notes for Implementation

1.  **SEO Keyword Enforcement**:
    -   Keywords from architecture doc (e.g., "foundation bottle supplier", "lipstick tube manufacturer") are integrated.
    -   Transactional signals like "MOQ" and "Free Samples" are placed in Meta Descriptions.

2.  **FAB Model Application**:
    -   Hero Copy follows `Feature -> Advantage -> Benefit` logic link.
    -   Example: `In-House Mold (Feature) -> Faster Dev (Advantage) -> Launch Faster (Benefit)`.

3.  **UI Terminology**:
    -   Filter labels use specific B2B terms ("Heavy Wall", "Tech-Plastic") rather than generic ones to signal industry expertise.
